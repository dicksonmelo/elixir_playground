# Elixir Playground

In lib folder you can find all codes that I have been trying. Some of them are exercises from the book ["Learn Functional Programming With Elixir"]("https://www.amazon.com.br/Functional-Programming-Elixir-Ulisses-Almeida/dp/168050245X/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3AM206AZOBQFF&keywords=learn+functional+programming+elixir&qid=1649887967&sprefix=learn+functional+programminng+elixi%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.fcd6d665-32ba-4479-9f21-b774e276a678") by Ulisses Almeida, others are just stuff I thought would be fun to do.
